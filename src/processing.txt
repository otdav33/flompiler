1. Starts merged.
2. Assign every function a bit of code that represents it (string).
3:
A. All functions will be walked once, where their code will be processed into a buffer per assigned straight.
Straight processing will go as follows:
	1. Go through all functions every cycle.
	2. If all a function's parents (the functions that give to that function) have been run, run the function:
		a. put in the code
		b. set it to run
	3. Record if there was a change
	4. If there was no change, escape.
B. If an ancestor depends on a decendant, turn it into a while loop.
C. If a function might not return at all, turn it into an if statement.
