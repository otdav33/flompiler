1. take from SVG a data tree with:
	-statement name
	-outputs[# of inputs][number of branches from each input]
	-the arrow should end within +-6px of the node to count.
2. merge all starts to a single start.
3. remove end statements
4. transliterate to C
	-lots of macro functions
	-should give everything its own variable of names v1, v2, v3, etc.
	-By default, things should go in main.
5. If a branch is encountered, it should evaluate both sides in whichever order.
6. If a merge is encountered, it should make everything after a function and call that.
7. If code high up is needed down low, it should be passed through functions.
8. variable reuse
9. comment translation
